# num1 = 1
# num2 = 6
# name = "Kellie"

# you can use input to take in an input and give an output based on the input. 
# in the example below, the input defines the name variable and will give an output requesting input with "What is your name?"
# you then would have to type a response 
# you will get back the print output with what was typed defined as the name variable.

# name = input("What is your name? ")
# print("Hello", name , "Bye", name)



# age = input("What is your age? ")
# age = int(age)

# # print(type(age))
# print(age)

#The Answer is 42!!

# the_answer = 42
# your_answer = int(input("Your number: "))
# # print (type(your_answer))
# print(the_answer != your_answer)

#Booleans using any function
# collections = [True, False, False]
# #will check if any from the collection are the same.
# print(any(collections))

# print (all(collections))

#The Answer is 42!! Exercise
# age = int(input("Your Age: "))
# print(age >= 18)
# #For 42, True
# #For -5, False
# #For "Hallo World!", Traceback "invalid literal for int() with base 10."

# result = True and not False or False 
# print (result)
